# ALGuideCompilation
A small tkinter app in python that serves as a compilation of guides for the mobile game Azur Lane.


**Question: How can I use it?**

1. You will need to download Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you don't already have it downloaded in your computer!
   https://youtu.be/YxHplztMQMc This video is a personal guide I used to downloading Python and one of the most popular IDEs to 
   run python code, Pycharm (free) but feel free to follow any guide you like!
 
2. Once you have Python and Pycharm in your computer you're ready to run this application! So here's how to download it: 

	- Once you start up Pycharm you will be prompted with something like this:

	- Click on "Check out from Version Control" then click on "Git", you will be prompted to enter a URL for a repository. 

	- In order to get this repository click on the "Clone or Download" green button of this repository, and copy the url
	  into the prompt, if done right you can click the "Test" button and check if the connection was successfull:

3. In order to successfully run this, you first need to install one external library for it to work, Pillow. 
   From Pycharm this is very simple: 

	- Once inside your main Pycharm project go to File -> Settings -> Project Interpreter, you should see a window like this 
	  (For your case it will probabbly be empty, but that's because most of these are from other projects I've worked on):

	- Click the "+" sign in order to add a new library.

	- And make sure to select the correct Pillow which should be the first option, and click "Install Package":

 ## Disclaimer: 
 
 This is just a passion project I created on my free time, I want to dedicate this for all those Shikikans that are kinda lost 
 when it comes to equips/how to play the game but my main purpose for this is to get people into the world of programming, it's 
 one of the best careers you can take at this point in time and its very fun!
